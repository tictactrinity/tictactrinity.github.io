# Water Analogy

Christians often talk about water as an analogy to trinity. They will come and say that God is like water, it can exist as liquid, steam and ice or sometimes they will talk about a body of water. This is wrong on multiple levels.


## 1. Composition
As a direct implication of using water as an analogy, what they’re submitting to is that God is composed of three distinct things. One thing they do not take into account is that water exists as a composition of multiples of the same thing. For water to exist in a state, more than one molecule has to exist in the same collection. A single molecule of water cannot be solid, liquid or gas by itself as the molecule would just exist in a state of either lower energy or a high energy. One could even say that the molecule itself can exist on a spectrum of energy.

This composition leads them down the heresy of Partialism. 

## 2. Dependence
The second issue with using the water as analogy is the implication of the state being changed on an external source. If water is analogous to God, then it would not need an external source to change the state it is in. but in reality solid requires energy applied by an external source to change the state to liquid and from liquid to gas.

## 3. Containment
Solid can directly change to gas in a process called sublimation, but that would also require pressure to be applied. So now, not only is the water ice requiring an energy source to heat up, it’s also being contained in a high pressure container for it to go from solid to gas.

## 4. Transference
Another argument with water is usually that if one is standing at a lake and one fills a bottle of water, is that still lake water? The things that are ignored in this are several.

Firstly it would be containment for it to be in a lake and also in the bottle therefore limiting God to an analogy of something that has to be contained or collected.

Secondly it would be the composition as you are able to take some of it away leaving the rest behind. How many of the molecules of water are there in a lake and how many were taken from the lake and transferred to the bottle? This question alone breaks the infinite nature of God.

Thirdly this analogy fails as the lake isn't existing in perpetuity (or eternally), the lake has to be replenished by rain, so is it lake water which it was collected in or rain water where it got sent from? This also makes it dependent on a source other than the lake itself. When you consume the water in the bottle, is it still lake water or is it now bottle water? The consumed water is digested and works it's way through your body ending its journey in the urine. Is it now bottle water or body water? The cycle continues and on this earth the cycle is depending on the Sun, which heats up the river/sea/ocean which forms the rain clouds, which feed the glaciers, lakes and rivers which in turn either evaporate, get consumed or end up back in the sea/ocean/river.
