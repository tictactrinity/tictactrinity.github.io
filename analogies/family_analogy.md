It is like a "Smith" family.

John Smith (Father)
James Smith (Son)
Jaden Smith (Holy Spirit)

They are all Smith, John is in James, and James is in Jaden because they share familial relationship.

But John is not James and James is not John, though even if they are both Smith.

There are several problems with this analogy.

#### 1. Identity
Whilst the family itself can be referred to as one, you cannot say 'Smith' and and have it just mean that one family. Itself, it is a noun and requires further qualifiers. You can refer to it as 'the Smith family' or you can refer to the family as 'the Smiths'. If you want to refer to an individual from the family it requires us to use qualifiers like 'a Smith' or 'from the Smiths'.

Translating that to 'God', the qualifiers would be 'the Gods' or 'the God family', and an individual would require to be referred to as 'a God' or 'from the Gods'. 

This breaks monotheistic requirement for God to be one.

#### 2. Plurality
As stated above, there is no way to refer to the family as a singular that does not require qualifiers. Therein lies the problem, that there is no way to actually talk about the family without the inherent plurality attached to it. In terms of singularity/plurality, 'the Smiths' is correct as an identifier for three people with distinct personhoods. In terms of singularity of God, you'd have to refer to them as 'the Gods', not 'the God'.

Whilst being one family, the family doesn't exist without the three composing members in it. There is no such thing as a family of one, that would just be one individual.

#### 3. Knowledge
The analogy breaks down here further because you cannot affirm the same set of [[Knowledge]]. For God to be 'all knowledgeable', the members of the family have to be all knowledgeable too. There will always remain this one difference in each of the members of family. Whilst each of them has this knowledge that they are a 'Smith' from our example, none of them have this knowledge that he is 'the Smiths' in its entirety. The knowledge is dependent on the other two existing as a 'Smith' and requires for the all three to exist at the same time for them to be 'all knowing' but even then the knowledge exists with at least six conflicting points.

This breaks the Aseity.

#### 4. Eternal
The family analogy has a fundamental issue when it comes to 'Eternal' attribute of God. In our example, for 'the Smiths' to be eternal, they all equally have to be eternal exclusive to each other.  If James Smith and Jaden Smith are proceeding from John Smith, then there is a dependence built into the analogy where John would have to be the first of the three.

The wording in the doctrine of trinity has no provision for this. It explicitly states 'proceeds from' for two of the three members of the trinity. In terms of 'God', the other side of this is if the 'procession' is removed, it would implicitly make God tritheistic.

This goes directly against monotheism.

#### 5. Category
This is similar to “Category” argument. God category by requirement would only be all knowing by inference, making it dependent on the members being all knowing. The members know they are not each other therefore inducing a conflict in knowledge.
