## Introduction
The trinitarian belief that God is three persons and one essence is often at the centre of discussions and debate. Trinitarians argue that this **mechanism** for God's existence is logical and that it is the case. The following cases have been extracted out of a study into the epistemic coherence of the trinitarian idea/doctrine of God's existence according the trinitarians. The approach of this study has been anecdotal while testing the answers given by the respondents against [Laws of Thought](https://www.britannica.com/topic/laws-of-thought).

This work is still underway and will be published in a book along with gathered evidence of the belief of trinitarian respondents but I thought it might be useful for other people to use.

## Technique

The technique requires people to answer a series of nine questions as follows:

| Number | Question |
| ------ | -------- |
| f1 | Does the Father know He is the Father or does He know is not the Father? |
| f2 | Does the Father know He is the Son or does He know He is not the Son? |
| f3 | Does the Father know He is the Holy Spirit or does He know He is not the Holy Spirit? |
| s1 | Does the Son know He is the Father or does He know is not the Father? |
| s2 | Does the Son know He is the Son or does He know He is not the Son? |
| s3 | Does the Son know He is the Holy Spirit or does He know He is not the Holy Spirit? |
| h1 | Does the Holy Spirit know He is the Father or does He know is not the Father? |
| h2 | Does the Holy Spirit know He is the Son or does He know He is not the Son? |
| h3 | Does the Holy Spirit know He is the Holy Spirit or does He know He is not the Holy Spirit? |

The answers are then represented as:

- **Y** for the Person knows that He is the Person being asked about
- **N** for the Person knows that He is not the Person being asked about

The question numbered above represent the table as below:

| Know   | F   | S   | HS  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| **F**  | f1  | f2  | f3  |
| **S**  | s1  | s2  | s3  |
| **HS** | h1  | h2  | h3  |

These numbers are used as subscript for reference to the answer.

This series of questions will force trinitarians into either modalism or tritheism.

## Distinct

These are the most common types of trinitarians. Their view is closely matched by the orthodox trinitarian doctrine.

#### What to ask?

1. Ask the respondent if they believe in 1 God
2. Ask them if they believe God is triune
3. Ask them the nine questions outlined in the [Technique](#technique) above

This specific trinitarians, answer should look as below:

| Know   | F   | S   | HS  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| **F**  | Y <sub>f1</sub> | N <sub>f2</sub> | N <sub>f3</sub> |
| **S**  | N <sub>s1</sub> | Y <sub>s2</sub> | N <sub>s3</sub> |
| **HS** | N <sub>h1</sub> | N <sub>h2</sub> | Y <sub>h3</sub> |

4. Ask them to affirm if they say "God is all-knowing"
5. Ask them  if they say "Father, Son and Holy Spirit is one God"
6. Ask them to affirm "God knows He is the Father (**f1**), God knows He is not the Father (**s1**) and God knows He is not the Father (**h1**)"
7. Ask them to affirm "God knows He is not the Son (**f2**), God knows He is the Son (**s2**) and God knows He is not the Son (**h2**)"
8. Ask them to affirm "God knows He is not the Holy Spirit (**f3**), God knows He is not the Holy Spirit (**s3**) and God knows He is the Holy Spirit (**h3**)"

#### Result

This will lead them to either assign the knowledge center to God or just the persons.
1. If they assign the knowledge center to the persons, then they are professing that a mind is not shared amongst the persons. The argument that "God is all knowing" would be up for a serious challenege.
2. If they assign the knowldge center to God, simply ask them then why don't the persons know the same thing as God?

## Indistinct

This is also a common type of trinitarian though their belief and understanding goes against the orthodox trinitarian belief and doctrine.

#### What to ask?

1. Ask the respondent if they believe in 1 God
2. Ask them if they believe God is triune
3. Ask them the nine questions outlined in the [Technique](#technique) above

| Know   | F   | S   | HS  |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| **F**  | Y <sub>f1</sub> | Y <sub>f2</sub> | Y <sub>f3</sub> |
| **S**  | Y <sub>s1</sub> | Y <sub>s2</sub> | Y <sub>s3</sub> |
| **HS** | Y <sub>h1</sub> | Y <sub>h2</sub> | Y <sub>h3</sub> |

4. Ask them to affirm if they say "God is all-knowing"
5. Simply ask them "who died on the cross"?

#### Result

Their most likely answer will be the Son/Jesus. Point out that Father and Holy spirit both know that they are the Son, so when the Son is being crucified and dies, Father and Holy Spirit should also know that they are being crucified and dying.

## Further development

The technique will be published in a book with more cases that have been discovered based on this technique. This is just a small part of a larger topic about epistemology of trinity.
