# Jesus is Muslim

Often times, Christians will come and question muslims on how Jesus is Muslim? Sometimes they will say "prove it according to your paradigm".

# Prove from Islamic Paradigm and Being Accused of Circular Reasoning
One of the conversation will go something as follows:

1. "How is Jesus muslim?" > "Because the Quran says so"   
2. "Why do you believe it?" > "I believe the Quran is the word of God"
3. "How do you know it is the word of God?" ? "Because the Quran says so"
4. "Oh so 'Quran is true, because it says that it is true'" > "Where in my reasoning did I make that claim yet?"

At this point, they will start saying "this is circular reasoning". This might look circular at first glance, but lets take a deeper look.

## Analysing the Questions
### 1. "How is Jesus muslim?"
This question requires a Theological claim as an answer because you will have to rely on some theology, in this case Islamic. According to the Islamic Theology:

_Muslims believe that Isa AS (Jesus) is Muslim along with all the Prophets of God starting from Adam AS to Prophet Muhammad PBUH, as the definition of Muslim is someone that submits his will to Allah, the one true God._

So your answer would be something like _"Quran says so"_ or _"Quran relays conversations between Jesus and his followers that they would be muslims"_ ([Surah Ali-Imran 3:52](https://quran.com/3/52) and [Surah Al-Maâ€™idah 5:111](https://quran.com/5/111)).

### 2. "Why do you believe it?"
This question relies on belief, so this is now a shift in the subject matter of the question. We've gone from Theology to Personal belief without the questioner first dealing with the answer that has been given. This is a moving of the goalpost and is now testing the respondent's foundational belief.

The answer can simply be provided as _"The Quran says it is from God"_.

This is where you will be accused of using circular logic. This is an attempt to question or disrupt your belief compared to your theological claim. This answer is still consistent with the framework.

### 3. "So _'Quran is true because it says that it is true'_?"
This is now changing the goalpost to Justification of the Source Authority all the while the question of "how is jesus muslim" has already been answered. Look through the the questions and responses, nowhere have you yet claimed that the Quran is true. This could only be claimed to be circular reasoning if the respondent claims _the Quran is true because it says that it is true_. so the questioner has jumped the gun and not allowed a proper discourse as to why the Quran is true.
